# 03.09: SERVICE WORKER DEV TOOLS CONTINUED
Having to close the tab or navigate away from the page in order to get the `Service Worker` to update to the new version is a bit of a pain during development, but thankfully there are ways to make it easier.

Rather than closing the tab or navigating to another origin, reload the page while holding `SHIFT`. This loads the page, but bypasses the `Service Worker`. This is handy for two reasons:

  1. It's a quick way to test changes that are unrelated to the `Service Worker`, such as minor CSS changes.
  
  2. Because the tab is no longer controlled by the `Service Worker`, it lets the waiting Service Worker take over.

If you refresh normally now, the request will go through the new `Service Worker`.

This way of bypassing the `Service Worker` and then refreshing is easier than navigating away from the origin or closing the tab, but Chrome's developer tools offer an even easier way:

In the `Application` tab of Chrome developer tools, there is an option called `Update on reload`. This changes the `Service Worker` lifecycle to be developer friendly. In this mode, when you hit refresh, rather than refreshing the page it fetches a `Service Worker` and treats it as a new version whether it has changed or not and lets it become active immediately. With this option active, you do not have to hold `SHIFT` and refresh or navigate away from the page.
